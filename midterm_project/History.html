        <h2>Back story</h2>

        <p>The New York Giants, an American football team which currently plays in the National Football League's National Football Conference, has a history dating back more than 80 seasons. The Giants were founded in 1925 by Tim Mara in the then five-year-old NFL. Mara owned the team until his death in 1959, when it was passed on to his sons, Wellington and Jack. From 1981 to 1990, the team qualified for the postseason seven times and won Super Bowls XXI and XXV. The team's success during the 1980s was aided by head coach Bill Parcells, quarterback Phil Simms and Hall of Fame linebackers Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson.They returned to the Super Bowl in 2000, but lost to the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. The Giants then won against New England Patriots in Super Bowls XLII and XLVI. This leads them to having 4 Super Bowl Rings.</p>

       <p>The Super Bowl is the annual American football game that determines the champion of the National Football League (NFL). The game culminates a season that begins in the previous calendar year, and is the conclusion of the NFL playoffs. The contest is held in an American city, chosen three to four years beforehand,usually at warm-weather sites or domed stadiums.Since January 1971, the winner of the American Football Conference (AFC) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference (NFC) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs.Before the 1970 merger between the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL), the two leagues met in four such contests. The first two were marketed as the "AFL–NFL World Championship Game", but were also casually referred to as "the Super Bowl game" during the television broadcast.[3] Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the "Super Bowl" moniker in official marketing; the names "Super Bowl I" and "Super Bowl II" were retroactively applied to the first two games.[4] The NFC/NFL leads in Super Bowl wins with 27, while the AFC/AFL has won 26. Twenty franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city, have won the Super Bowl.The New England Patriots (6–5) and Pittsburgh Steelers (6–2) have won the most Super Bowls with six championships, while the Dallas Cowboys (5–3) and the San Francisco 49ers (5–1) have five wins. New England has the most Super Bowl appearances with eleven, while the Buffalo Bills (0–4) have the most consecutive appearances with four (all losses) from 1990 to 1993.

        <p>American football player Lawrence Taylor was a member of the New York Giants and is considered one of the best linebackers in the history of the game.Lawrence Taylor was born on February 4, 1959 in Williamsburg, Virginia. He entered the NFL draft in 1981 and was the second overall pick, selected by the New York Giants. During his 13-year career, he was named an All-Pro six times (1981–1987) and made 10 Pro Bowl appearances (1981–1990 seasons). He was inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999.Lawrence Taylor, a ground-breaking NFL linebacker known for his size and speed, was born Lawrence Julius Taylor on February 4, 1955, in Williamsburg, Virginia. A late bloomer, he didn't start playing football until his junior year at Lafayette High School.As a result, he was not highly recruited and eventually landed at the University of North Carolina. There, Taylor, who earned the nickname "Godzilla," quickly began to terrorize opposing quarterbacks. His speed, size (6'4'', 240 pounds), and fury made him an almost unstoppable weapon and in the 1981 draft, the New York Giants selected Taylor with the No. 2 overall pick.</p>
