        <h3>News</h3>

        <p>The player the Giants got back from the Browns in the mega-trade that sent Odell Beckham Jr. to Cleveland could be a dream for Giants defensive coordinator James Bettcher, who likely already knows what to do with the new gem in a treasure chest that could use plenty more of them.The Giants see Peppers, 23, as a classic strong safety, with the versatility to play low and high.</p>

       <p>As a rookie with the Browns in 2017, Peppers battled through some physical issues and played so deeply as a free safety that at times it was difficult for him to get to the ball. Last season, with Peppers re-aligned as the strong safety, he put on display the ability he showed while winning four New Jersey state championships and during his three years starring, mostly at linebacker, at Michigan.</p>

        <h2>ODELL TRADED</h2>
        <p>According to Adam Schefter of ESPN, the trade involves the Browns sending their first-round pick in 2019 (No. 17 overall), one of the Browns third-round picks this year (their second one) as well as safety Jabrill Peppers.The Giants and Browns will also not be swapping picks that were agreed upon in the Olivier Vernon trade earlier this week.It's a stunner of a deal and, frankly, an incredible steal for the Browns. They lose a potential stud and former first-round pick in terms of Peppers but their offense is suddenly LOADED.Baker Mayfield, who should have been the 2018 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, will be throwing to Beckham, Jarvis Landry (OBJ's teammate at LSU), Antonio Callaway and David Njoku. Not too shabby, and you can throw Nick Chubb into the mix in the backfield as well. This is suddenly a filthy offense the Browns are trotting out onto the field as they hope to contend for the division title.</p>
